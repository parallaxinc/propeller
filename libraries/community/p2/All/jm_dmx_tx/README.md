Description:
The object facilitates DMX signaling from the P2 using a simple, half-duplex interface circuit. The object allows the user to set the universe size for specialty applications that do not need 512 channels -- setup parameters allow the application to set the number of channels, the break-to-break timing, and the buffer used to hold DMX channel data.

Demo code runs the low-cost Chauvet LED-Splash lighting fixture.
