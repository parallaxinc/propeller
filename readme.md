# Propeller Repository
This repository is a collection of information and source code written for (and often written by) the Parallax Propeller Community.  Most recent activity involves resources for the Propeller 2 Microcontroller; however, all Propeller 1 objects formerly published on the Propeller Object Exchange are now located in the /libraries/community/p1 folder.

## Want to contribute?
Parallax welcomes Propeller Community members to [contribute to this repository](https://github.com/parallaxinc/propeller/wiki/Contributing).  Don't allow great resources to remain buried in the forums - share them here in a version-controlled, centralized place for new and existing users to enjoy.  
- Have you created example Propeller 2 code you want to share?
- Do you know of (or have created) Propeller 2 tools, tips, etc.?
- Want to share your trusty Propeller 1 objects?

Please [follow these steps](https://github.com/parallaxinc/propeller/wiki/Contributing) to include them here for all to see.
