# Examples Folder
This folder contains Propeller 2 example code developed and shared by the Propeller Community.  

## Contents and Structure
As the Propeller 2 is tested and further materials are developed, this folder and it's contents should evolve organically to stay organized- items categorized in subfolders.

Contributors can [create](https://github.com/parallaxinc/propeller/wiki/Contributing) and/or [suggest](mailto:developer+github@parallax.com?subject=Propeller+Repository+Suggestion) new or renamed subfolders when the need arises.
